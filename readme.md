# Load Monitor

## To Run

- run `npm install`
- run `node server.js`
- open `index.html` in a browser


## Future Improvements

- enable CORS on the server
- store data in a DB 
  - to enable wider/customizable time spans
  - so past 10 min of data can be served on new connections 
- Add customization for timespan/warnings/refresh, etc... on the client side
- split up view into components
  - one component for graph, one for history of warnings
